# PhotoDump ðŸ“¸

A secure client-side photo gallery application built with React and Supabase. This project allows users to securely log in, upload photos to a private gallery, manage their profile, and delete their images. A key feature is the rendering of all images onto HTML `<canvas>` elements to deter simple right-click downloading.

-   **Enhanced Security:**

    -   Robust Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on the Supabase backend ensure users can only access and manage their own data.
